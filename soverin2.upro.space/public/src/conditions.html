            <p>3.1. Soverin offers an ad-free email service with optional extra features and a maximum GB capacity (‘Service’). For consumers, the standard capacity as part of the Service is 25 GB, with the option to buy extra GB capacity. For corporate customers, the capacity is agreed upon in a countersigned separate document. The Service will be made available to You after the Agreement is concluded. To use our Service, when registering we ask You to create an email address so we can enable You to activate the use of the Service with a password of Your choice. Our Service is designed to maximize Your privacy and keep You in control of Your personal data. We therefore want to know as little of You as possible, so please be aware that if You forget Your password and did not store the recovery code and/or a phone number, We can no longer enable you to use the Service which is supplied to You.</p>
            <p>3.2. For a full overview of the features included in the Service, please visit www.soverin.net. Soverin uses third parties to offer certain extra options. For example, Soverin offers personalized domain names. In order to offer this option, Soverin registers the domain You wish to use (if available) with a Dutch domain name provider and invoices You for the extra fees. Application, assignment and possible use of a domain name is dependent upon and are subject to the applicable rules and procedures of the relevant registering authorities, such as Stichting Internet Domeinregistratie Netherlands. The relevant body decides on the allocation of a
              domain name and/or IP address. We only play a mediating role in the application and give no guarantee that an application will be honored.</p>

            <h2 id="s4">4. Offer and acceptance</h2>

            <p>4.5. After the Agreement has been concluded, Soverin will provide the Service to You as soon as possible. In case You are a person not acting in de exercise of a profession or business, You hereby agree that Soverin may start the Service during the statutory cancellation period (wettelijke bedenktermijn) and that You are obliged to pay for the performed work if You terminate the Agreement during the statutory cancellation period.

This recovery code can be used
              in case You forget Your password and don’t have access to the phone You used when You signed up for Soverin. The recovery code will enable You to sign in and subsequently alter Your password. Please store Your code safely, the code is personal and only provided to You, so Soverin does not keep a copy of the code.</p>
