Most people and companies set up email addresses to reflect individuals’ names: whether it’s a first and last name, first initial and last name, etc. In your own domain, this is even more the case. But sometimes you just don't want to share this information. That's why you get a free randomly generated alias for your mailbox on our @sinenomine.email domain that can not be tracked back to your real email address. It does, however, deliver emails sent to it in your mailbox.
