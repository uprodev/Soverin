‘Free’ email providers sell your personal data to advertisers. Your private messages are scanned for relevant keywords and the data is sold to advertisers. With Soverin, you get the same experience as you would with any ‘free’ email provider, except that for us privacy comes first. We started Soverin because we value privacy. The information in your emails is for your eyes and the intended recipient only. We will never track your information and sell it for profit
