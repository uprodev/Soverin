Most email providers have a lock-in. Since most of them donâ€™t offer custom domains, if you join them you will get an email address with their subdomain (for example, Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo, etc). However, with Soverin, you can easily move your own domain and email address. You can easily import/export your emails and take them with you. With Soverin, your email and domain are truly yours.
