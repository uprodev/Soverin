Yes. Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) and Sender Policy Framework (SPF)are used to tell other mail servers who is allowed to send email for our and our customer domains. It also instructs other email servers what to do with emails they receive from other (unauthorized) systems.
